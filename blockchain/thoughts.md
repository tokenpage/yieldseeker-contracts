- Agents are kinda generic (asset-wise) at the moment
    - seems like it would be easier if we just specifically said they were for USDC
    - same with vault registry - probably easier if we could register vaults against an asset
- We only support a few functions, if we need to do more in the future (e.g. a new type of call like requestRedeem) we would need to deploy a whole new suite of contracts / agents which is annoying
